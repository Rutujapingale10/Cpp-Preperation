Abstract class is a class Where class type exist but object doesnâ€™t exist.

We cannot create an object of such classes but create pointer of such classes.

To create class Abstract we have to write pure virtual function .

Function does not have definition but It has declaration we have to declare it to zero.

We have to define pure virtual function in classes those we have derived from an abstract class.

If we do not override pure virtual function in derived class then derived will also become abstract.
