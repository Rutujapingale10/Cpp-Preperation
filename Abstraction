Abstraction is selective ignorance.

Or we can say hiding of data

Example of person holding educational and medical data.

Abstraction Using classes
By using access specifier we can decide that which data member we want to show outside world or which is not

Abstraction Using Header files -
Suppose we want to calculate power of any number then we just add math.h header file and use power function with syntax.

Programming behind that power function is in that header file without knowing that we using power function.
