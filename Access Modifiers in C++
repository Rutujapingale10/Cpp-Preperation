Access modifiers are basically used to hide data.
Access specifiers are used to set restrictions on data.

By default access specifier is private.(in structure it is public)

There are 3 types of access modifiers available in C++
1)Public
2)Private
3)Protected

Public:
Data member and member function declared as public can be accessed by other classes and functions too
Public members of class can be access anywhere by using . Operator

Class.
 we can  accessed indirectly  public member function declared inside class.

Only member functions and friend functions are allowed to access private data of class.
