1)Constructor is a special member function which gets called automatically at the time of object
Creation.
2)For each object constructor called separately and only once.
3)constructor has a same name as class name.
4)constructor do not have return type not even void.
5)constructor used to initialized object(that is provide initialized state)
6)constructor used to allocate memory.

Types of constructor
1)built  in constructor - Built in constructor provides garbage values
2)default constructor - constructor doesn’t take any argument. It has no parameter.
3)Parameterized constructor - Constructor with argument it has parameter.
4)copy constructor - copy constructor initializes an object using another object using another object
Of same class.


 case
1)When there is no programmer defined constructor built in by default constructor is given
 2)default constructor is available but there is no parameterized constructor we can create default that is zero argument constructor but cannot create parameterized object.
3)Default and parameterized both are available we can create both type of object.
4)when we don’t write default but write parameterized constructor we can create only
Parameterized object.
