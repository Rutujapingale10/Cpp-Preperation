Copy constructor is a constructor which takes same type of object as a parameter.

We can implement copy constructor by using reference variable
We must use reference variable if we do not use reference variable   
Recursion occure and that recursion detect at compile time and compilation error appiers


Why we need copy constructor -
To avoid shallow copy and if necessary go for deep copy.
Explicit copy constructor or user defined copy constructor is needed when objects needed 
Pointer or non  sharable references.

There are two types of copy constructor 
1)Implicit copy constructor - do shallow copy
2)Explicit Copy Constructor - do deep copy
