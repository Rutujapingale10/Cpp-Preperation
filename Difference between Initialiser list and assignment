Initializer List

Members are initialize before constructor body executes.

More efficient.

Can initialize const and reference member(which must be initialized at the time of creation)


Assignment

Members are initialize after entering the constructor body.


Less efficient.

Cannot be used to initialized const or reference member(because they cannot be reassigned after creation)
