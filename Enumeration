Enumeration is user defined data type that can assigned some another values. These value are defined by programmer at the time of declaration.

If we assigned float value to the character it will produce error, same way if we assign any other value to the enumerator
Data types then compiler produce error.

By default starting code value of first element of enum is 0. 
It can be changed explicitly.
 
Typedef
Mostly typedef  is used to create aliase if predefine name is too large and complex to used.
