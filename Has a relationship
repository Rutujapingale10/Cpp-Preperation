It is a process in which one class defines another class as an entity reference.

It is a another way to reuse classes.


Eg . We have 2 classes as employee and Address 

And want to write address of employee in this situation instead writing same things again 
We can simply create instance of that address class inside employee class as a member variable of that class.

First have to create instance of that class that we want to reuse
After creating instance we can treat that instance as member variable of another class
