In multiple inheritance class is derived from more than one base class.

i.e. one sub class is inherited from more than one base class.

Diamond problem - 

Diamond problem Occurs when two super classes of a class have common base class.

 This causes ambiguity error.

Object of derived class has 2 copies of All members of base class.

Means Constructor and Destructor of base  gets called  twice.

Solution of this problem is virtual keyword.

We have to inherit classes virtually from their base classes.

When we inherit classes virtually and create derived class's parameterized object then base 
Class's default constructor gets called automatically.

How to called parameterized constructor of grandparent.

We have to called constructor of grand parent in derived class.

Generally it is not allowed to write grand parent constructor in derived class directly.

But it is allowed with virtual keyword.
