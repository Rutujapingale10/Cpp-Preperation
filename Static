Static means one for class.

Static variable gets memory only once.

Static variables value can be change it will get change for all the object for class.

Once we declared static data member inside class we have to define them outside of a class
By using scope resolution operator .

In fact we cannot assign value on static in constructor.
If we do this them at every time of object creation value get initialize.

We cannot declare static data member in local classes.


In C++ it is must to initialize static static variable value outside of a class by using scope resolution operator.

Syntax - 
	dataType className :: variableName = value;
	
	Static functions can access only static variables.
	
	Non static variables can access static and non  static variables too.
