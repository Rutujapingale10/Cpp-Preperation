Structure
Structure is user defined data type.
Structure is logical binding of data to represent one particular entity.
It contain different types of data.(array contain same type of data)

Union -
Union is also user defines data type like structure and also hold different type of data.

Enum - 
Enum are user defined data types that contain named integer constant.
It helps to assign constant to set of names. (by default it start from 0)


Structure - 
	Structure member can be initialized  with declaration in C++  
	
	Struct emp{
		Int x = 0;
		Int y = 10;
	}
Array of structure - 
	Like other primitive member we can create array of structures.
	
	Structure pointer -
	Like other primitive data member we can have pointer to  structure. Members of structures are accessible using -> arrow operator. 

Self referential structure -  
	Self referential structure are those structure that have one or more pointers which points to same type of structure as there member.
	Two types of self referential pointer 
	1)self referential pointer with single link
	2)self referential pointer with double link
