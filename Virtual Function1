Let's see need of virtual first

If We want to execute all the characteristics of derived class with single reference.

That time we can create base class pointer and assigned derived class object on it 

But base class pointer always call base class methods to avoid this we have to keep base class functions as a virtual.

Similarly we have base class pointer and we trying to delete derived class object then it will always call base class destructor.
To avoid this we have to keep base class destructor as virtual.
