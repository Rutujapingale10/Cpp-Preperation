In Upcasting Base class Pointer pointing derived class's object.


Means base class pointer containing address of derived class.
Derived d;
Base *b = &d;



By creating base class pointer and assigning derived class object on it we can access

Derived class properties through pointer by keeping base class function as virtual.



Down casting is opposite of up casting 

Child class pointer contain address of base class.

Child *obj = (Child*)&base_obj 


We manually cast base class object to derived class object so we must specify explicit type cast.
